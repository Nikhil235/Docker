# Docker
What is Docker ? and why ?

Docker is a container technology : ( A tool for creating & managing containers )

Container -> A standardized unit of software
          -> A package of code and dependencies to run that code ( e.g. Node.js code + node.js Runtime )
         
          1. The Same container always yields the exact same applications and execution behavior ! No matter where or by whom it might be executed.
          
          2. Support for containers is built into modern opertating systems.
          
          3. Docker simplifies the creation and management of such containers.
